# GSK Clinical Trial Response Analysis

## Overview
This project explores clinical trial data from the GSK x DigData Step Up Challenge using R. It involves cleaning, merging, analysing and visualising patient data to assess treatment response patterns across two groups: a new drug (Miraculon-B) and the standard of care (Control).

---

## Objective
To  evaluate the effectiveness of the new drug compared to standard care by analysing variables such as age, BMI, and protein concentration, and comparing trends across treatment groups (Control vs. Drug).

---

## Tools Used
- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `gt`
- **Data Format**: CSV files

---

## Key Findings
- **Response Rate**: The Drug group had a significantly higher response rate (54.8%) than the Control group (32.2%).
- **Protein Levels**: Responders had consistently lower protein concentration levels, suggesting potential as a biomarker for treatment effectiveness.
- **Age & BMI**: No substantial influence of age or BMI on treatment response.

---

## Visuals Included
- Boxplots for Age, BMI, and Protein Concentration by Treatment Group and Response
- Tabular summaries for quick stakeholder interpretation

---

## Business Impact
Insights from this analysis can support clinical decision-making by identifying potential response indicators and helping target the most effective treatments for future patients, thus improving trial efficiency and patient outcomes.
