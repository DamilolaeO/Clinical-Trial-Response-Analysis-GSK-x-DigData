# Clinical_Trial_Response_Analysis-GSK
Data-driven analysis of clinical trial responses using R, focused on identifying treatment effectiveness patterns from the GSK x DigData challenge.
# Clinical Trial Response Analysis using R â€“ GSK x DigData

## Overview
This project explores clinical trial data from the GSK x DigData career challenge. The aim was to investigate treatment response patterns among patients using statistical techniques in R, focusing on demographic and clinical indicators like age, BMI, and protein concentration.

---

## Objective
To identify factors associated with positive treatment response in a clinical trial by analyzing variables such as age, BMI, and protein concentration, and comparing trends across treatment groups (Control vs Drug).

---

## Tools Used
- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`
- **Data Format**: CSV files

---

## Key Findings
- **Response Rate**: Drug group had a significantly higher response rate (54.8%) than the Control group (32.2%).
- **Protein Levels**: Responders had consistently lower protein concentration levels, suggesting potential as a biomarker for treatment effectiveness.
- **Age & BMI**: No substantial influence of age or BMI on treatment response.

---

## Visuals Included
- Boxplots for Age, BMI, and Protein Concentration by Treatment Group and Response
- Tabular summaries for quick stakeholder interpretation

---

## Business Impact
Insights from this analysis can support clinical decision-making by identifying potential response indicators and helping target the most effective treatments for future patients, thus improving trial efficiency and patient outcomes.
